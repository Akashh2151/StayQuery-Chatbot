# chatbot
 This project is an interactive chatbot application built using Streamlit, designed to query and analyze data from a MySQL database containing hotel booking information. Users can input natural language queries, which the chatbot processes using a dataframe agent powered by OpenAI's API, to retrieve and display relevant data insights dynamically.
